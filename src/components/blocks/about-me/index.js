            I'm Alexandra, a Front-end Javascript Engineer with a working
            knowledge of UX design principles. I decided to study computer
            science in high school, due to my wonderful computer science teacher
            at that time. I started learning HTML/CSS at the age of 14 and C at
            the age of 17.

            I have experience in building software and web applications for more
            than 3 years. I enjoy creating simple, clean and creative user
            interfaces using the latest web technologies. I specialize in
            JavaScript and have professional experience working with modern
            frameworks.

            I enjoy content creation and as a hobby I write some articles about
            various JS topics on dev.to/ale3oula. I also have my tech Instagram
            account where I create imagery content covering a number of topics,
            like UIs, setup, code bits and more @ale3.js

            When not working, I'm likely watching Superhero movies in cinema or
            series on Netflix, re-reading Neil Gaiman books, travelling the
            world or taking strolls with my camera!
